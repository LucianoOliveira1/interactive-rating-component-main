# Interactive rating component
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI) Interactive rating component HTML, CSS and JavaScript challenge

# Description:

This challenge required a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The goal was to recrate a interactive rating component from the design files for reference.

# What I Learned (as a newbie):
**Coding is not easy, but the feeling of achieving it is wonderful!**
Perhaps one of the most important lessons I learned was that sometimes it's taking a step back. Knowing what needs to be done is quite different from understanding what you want to do yourself, often the idea/logic is brilliant in your head, but coding is that you realize that not even you can understand what you created, imagine the computer.
It took a little time thinking and re-thinking, doing and doing so that with each attempt I could get closer to the solution you can see here! [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

**I learned and implemented javaScript**
 - Inicialmente eu comecei usando um <li> para fazer os botões de rating, mas tivi um pouco de dificuldade para acessar os valores dentro do Js, após isso, resolvi utilizar o <form>  o que facilitou um pouco as coisas.
- Outro aprendizado foi em relação ao "focusin", "target" e "focusout"(embora esse ultimo não tenha sido utilizado.

**Any feedback, criticism or comments regarding the project are very welcome!**
